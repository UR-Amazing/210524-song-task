Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
Out of things that I saw
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
And they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire, I followed them
Into the middle, I was led

As if time had stopped still, I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
Then I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures, they were undead, all of them
They had ascended from hell

As I danced with the dead, my free spirit was laughing
And howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
